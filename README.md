# piVirtualWire
Python VirtualWire module for Raspberry Pi and 433MHz RF modules

## Dependencies

This code depends on **pigpio** library and can not be used without it.

**Pigpio** library is available at [this site](http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/)

Follow [this](http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/download.html) guide to install it on your platform.

pigpio has to be running as a service. To start:
`sudo /home/pi/PIGPIO/pigpiod`

##Hardware
This has been tested with FS1000A sender and XY-MK-5V receiver. Communication over Virtual Wire was successful with Arduino Uno and Arduino Pro Micro.

# Example usage

Clone or download project to directory named:  `piVirtualWire`

## Sending data

```
import piVirtualWire.piVirtualWire as piVirtualWire
import time
import pigpio

pi = pigpio.pi()
tx = piVirtualwire.tx(pi, 4, 1000) # Set pigpio instance, TX module GPIO pin and baud rate

msg = 42

tx.put(msg)
tx.waitForReady()

tx.cancel()
pi.stop()
```

## Receiving data

```
import piVirtualWire.piVirtualWire as piVirtualWire
import time
import pigpio

pi = pigpio.pi()
rx = piVirtualWire.rx(pi, 18, 1000) # Set pigpio instance, TX module GPIO pin and baud rate

while True:

		while rx.ready():
			print(rx.get())

		time.sleep(0.5)

rx.cancel()
pi.stop()
```
